$$2 = \dfrac{20}{x^2+2}$$
$$2(x^2+2) = 20$$
$$x^2+2 = 10$$
$$x^2 = 8$$
$$x = \sqrt{8}$$
$$x = \sqrt{2*2*2}$$
$$x = 2\sqrt{2}$$

Max bacteria = 256

Function: $f(x) = 2^x$

Domain only makes sense while x, the bacteria in the dish is greater than zero (no negative bacteria) and less than the total area of the dish (less than 256).
Therefore:
$$2^x \leq 256$$
$$\log_2 {2^x} \leq \log_2 256$$
$$x \log_2 {2} \leq \log_2 256$$
$$x * 1 \leq \log_2 256$$
$$x \leq 8$$

$$(8x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x -7) - (5x^3 -3x^2 -2x + 4)$$
$$(3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x -7) - (-3x^2 -2x + 4)$$
$$(3x^3 + x^2 + 5x -7) - (-2x + 4)$$
$$(3x^3 + x^2 + 3x -7) - (4)$$
$$(3x^3 + x^2 + 3x - 11)$$

$$3x - 6 = 2x -2$$
$$x - 6 = -2$$
$$x = 4$$

Now substitute to find a single side:
$$2 * 4  -2 $$
$$8 -2$$
$$6$$

Now use perimiter formula:
$$P = 2w + 2l$$
$$P = 2 (13) + 2 (6)$$
$$P = 26 + 12$$
$$P = 38$$

# 6
Area formula: $A = l*w$
Perimeter Formula: $P = 2l + 2w$
Length: $x$
Width: $14 -x$

Solve for x:
$$P = 2(x) + 2(14 - x)$$
$$P = 2x + 28 - 2x$$
$$P = 28$$

Perfect square Trinomial: Trinomial that can be cleanly square rooted
Plug and play; correct answer shown:

Parallel lines have same slope; try each function to find the answer

# 10
Perpendicular lines have slope inverse of the line it is perpendicular; tl;dr flip rational number and negate it;
so slope of 3 become slope of $-1/3$

# 11
y is not domain so skip those answers;
try numbers in C, but not in D and see if the function is still true;
i.e. try using 1 and 0 and make sure it still works.

Exponents are opposites of logs:
$$4 = \log_2 x$$
$$2^4 = \log_2 2^x$$
$$2*4 = x$$
$$16 = x$$

Functions cannot have two differnt x values map to two different y values.  Table B has two different possible values for 2.

$$w = l +5$$
and
$$l = w -5$$
are valid descriptions of the relative sizes.
so solve:
$$A = w(l)$$
$$A = w(l -5)$$
$$A = w(w -5)$$
$$A = w^2 -5w$$

If x is always 2; there is never a change to calculate slope from;

Side of square is square root of area and $\sqrt 100 = 10$ therefore the size must be less than 10.
